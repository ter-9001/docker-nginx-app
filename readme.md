# 🐳 DevOps Project: Deploying a Monitored Nginx Application on AWS

This repository contains the necessary files and scripts to build, deploy, and monitor a simple web application (Nginx with an index.html page) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The main objective is to demonstrate a complete DevOps workflow, covering everything from containerization to monitoring:

* Containerization: Create a custom Docker image with Nginx and a static HTML page.
* Infrastructure: Provision the necessary AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
* Configuration & Deployment: Use Ansible to deploy the Docker container to the EC2 instance.
* Monitoring: Configure Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize instance and Nginx metrics.
